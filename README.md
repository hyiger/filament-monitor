# Filament Motion & Runout Monitor (Marlin / Prusa firmware)

A Raspberry Pi daemon that monitors **filament motion pulses** and an optional **runout signal**, and issues a pause command when motion is expected but not observed.

> **Beta release**
>
> This is a **1.0.0-beta** release. The control interface (`filmon:*`) and the state model are considered stable,
> but the project is still gathering real-world feedback. Expect conservative defaults and incremental refinements.

This project is intended for **Marlin-based firmware**, including **Prusa firmware variants**.

## Design Philosophy (Jam-Resistant Operation)

This monitor is intentionally conservative:

- False positives are considered worse than delayed detection
- Monitoring must be explicitly enabled via slicer or G-code markers
- Motion expectation is derived from *actual commanded extrusion*
- Jam detection requires multiple invariants to be violated simultaneously

The goal is predictable, reviewable behavior rather than aggressive detection.
